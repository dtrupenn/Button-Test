# iOS ButtonTest

This is a basic calculator UI (non functional) that resizes using iOS
6 autolayout feature.

## How to run
Open the project using Xcode by running the ButtonTest.xcodeproj file
included in this repository. Once project is loaded click the Run
button on Xcode.

## Notes
This project is a NON-FUNCTIONAL version of my previous iOS-Calculator
app with the sole purpose of testing the autolayout feature provided
by iOS.
